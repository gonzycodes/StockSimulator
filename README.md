# StockSimulator
StockSimulator is a Python-based trading simulator where users receive a virtual budget (e.g., 100,000 SEK) and can buy/sell stocks or cryptocurrencies using real market data. The project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming, API integration, data analysis, and visualization.
